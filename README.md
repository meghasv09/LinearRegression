# Univariate Linear Regression

## Overview
This project implements **Univariate Linear Regression** to predict **revenue** based on **population size**. The dataset consists of:  
- **Population size** (in 10,000s)  
- **Revenue** (in $10,000s)  

A **Linear Regression model** is trained to predict revenue based on the given population size. The implementation is written in **Python** and includes visualization of the results.

## Visualizations

### Linear Regression Model
The trained model fitting the dataset:

### Contour Plot  
The **contour plot** visualizes how the cost function behaves for different values of model parameters. The global minimum represents the optimal values of \(\theta_0\) and \(\theta_1\):

### Cost Function  
The cost function curve shows how the error decreases as training progresses:
